HISTORY : <h1>

The problem probably dates back to the "decimatio", the collective punishment practised by the Roman army where every tenth man in a detachment was chosen by drawing lots and punished. In literature, it is linked to an event that occurred in the life of the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus in 67 A.D. â€“ hence the name "the Josephus problem": when the city of Yodfat was besieged by the Roman General Vespasian, the Jewish soldiers decided to commit collective suicide. Nonetheless, Josephus was afraid to disagree so he suggested to arrange themselves in such a way that he and his best friend remained at the end after drawing lots.

RULE : <h1>

The Jewish solders would arrange themselves in a circle, and the 1st soldier would kill the person to the left of him - hence in clockwise direction. The next remaining living soldier would kill person to the left of him, and it repeats untill only one person is left. As Josephus wanted to survive, he had to figure out WHERE  he should sit within the circle.
